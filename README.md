Part Tips is a mod for KSP that allows the player to open the stock part tooltip on parts that are already attached to a craft, even when in flight. 

It's useful for checking the electrical and thermal requirements of your ISRU parts, for example, or checking the limitations of those solar panels you picked out earlier, and whether they supply enough juice for your ISRU parts. It's a lot to keep that all in your head and it's a bit of hassle to search for the part again in the parts list when you need a reminder.

- To use it just click with the **middle mouse button** on a part; click again to toggle the extended info panel. You can click anywhere else with the middle mouse button or right mouse button to dismiss the tooltip. 

- When in the editor you can ALT+MMB click a part to quickly locate that part in the parts list. This can be useful if you'd like to compare a part to the alternatives and it pairs very well with [VAB Organizer](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/VABOrganizer/releases).

It should be compatible with any mods that affect parts after they've already been placed like RealFuels or TweakScale. You can close and re-open a tooltip to refresh the information.
